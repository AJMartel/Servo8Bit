1) Make sure you have WinAvr installed (http://winavr.sourceforge.net/)
2) open a CMD window and navigate to the Servo8Bit folder
3) type in "make" in the CMD window and the code will be compiled
4) type in "make program" to program your Attiny. This assumes you are using a usb programer (such as the AVRISP mkII).
