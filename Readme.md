Version History
---------------

 * **V0.7**	
 	* Bug fix: If detach() was called on a servo then subsequent calls to attach() would fail.
          The detach() function now works properly.
 * **V0.6** 
    * Added ability to easily select if this driver should use timer0 or
	  timer1.
	* Timer1 is now the default timer used. Used to be timer0.
	* Made the timer init happen later to allow this driver to work when
	  used with an attiny arduino library.
	* Fixed bug where a 512 microsecond pulse would not be generated.
 * **V0.5**
 	* Initial public release
